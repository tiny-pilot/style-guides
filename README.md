# style-guides

This page defines TinyPilot's coding conventions for various programming languages.

## General

TinyPilot's style guides mostly inherit from other established style guides and make changes where we've felt the parent guide lacks specificity or makes a choice that's poorly suited for TinyPilot's work.

## Github pull requests

### Titles

The pull request (PR) title should summarize the change to make it easy for other developers to quickly scan through the change history for the repo or a file/folder.

* Aim for fewer than 80 characters.
  * This is a soft limit, but it's better to be succinct.
  * In some views (including on Github), exceeding 80 characters screws up the PR link.
* Use imperative mood ("Refactor input handling") rather than descriptive ("Refactors input handling").
* Use sentence casing ("Refactor input handling") rather than titel casing ("Refactor Input Handling").
* Omit trailing punctuation.
* Omit prefixes like "(chore)" or "(fix)".
* Omit Markdown formatting.
  * Github renders Markdown in PR titles, but not all git clients do.

### Descriptions

The pull request description should introduce the reader to the change and provide them with the context they need to review the change.

Write the pull request description so that it makes sense to anyone on the team, even if you have a particular reviewer in mind who has additional context. Other people might want to read the PR, and you might forget the context in the future if you look back on it.

#### What to include

The PR description should give a reviewer everything they need to review the PR effectively.

The reviewer should be able to review the PR without clicking external links in the PR description. The description should quote and summarize relevant details from external resources and link to them so that the reviewer can explore further if they choose. If you're linking to a bug, summarize the relevant details of the bug. If you're linking to external documentation, quote the relevant section and link back to the original (linking to the specific header if possible).

If you made design choices in the PR, explain why you chose a particular implementation over other possible candidates.

For very trivial PRs, the description is optional, but it's usually helpful to include a description.

#### Focus on the "why" rather than the "how"

The PR description is a description of the *change* rather than the code. It should answer the question, "Why are we making this change right now?"

If there's context the reader needs to understand the code, the code itself should provide that context either through naming or code comments. After the code is merged, the code needs to make sense to people who haven't read the pull request description.

##### Example bad description

>**Move user.js**
>
>This change moves user.js to the `src/controllers/auth` directory.

This is a poor description because it doesn't give the reader any information about the change beyond what they'd see in the diff.

##### Example good description

>**Move user.js to src/controllers/auth**
>
>When we created `user.js`, most of its callers lived in `src/lib/user`.
>
>We did a lot of restructing as part of the 4.2.x release, so now all of user.jsâ€™s clients live in `src/controllers/auth`, so this change moves `user.js` closer to the majority of its clients.

This is a better PR description because it explains the "why" behind the change. The reader has context to understand why this change is happening.

#### Cross-referencing issues

If the PR resolves a bug, include a line after the prose description that says `Fixes #XXX` where `XXX` is the number of the Github issue it resolves. The `Fixes #XXX` syntax tells Github to auto-close the associated issue when we merge the PR.

If the PR is related to an issue but doesn't fix it, add a line that says `Related #XXX` so that Github cross-references the PR from the associated bug.

#### Revise to match design changes

Sometimes the code review process causes changes in the code that make your original PR description obsolete. Remember to update your PR description to match the state of your code.

## Shell

- Base Guide: [Google Shell](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)

### Shellcheck

All repositories with shell scripts should enable shellcheck to run automatically in CI. See [the `check_bash` job](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml) in `tiny-pilot/tinypilot` for an example.

### Options

All bash scripts should default to these options unless there's a strong need to exclude any of them.

```bash
# Exit on first failure.
set -e

# Echo commands to stdout.
set -x

# Exit on unset variable.
set -u
```

### Comments

Comments begin with a capital letter and end with trailing punctuation.

```bash
# Our contract with FooVendor requires us to wait five seconds before each
# request.
TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5
```

### Variable names

Variable names should be all uppercase.

```bash
WELCOME_MESSAGE="Hello, world!"
```

```bash
for URL in "${URLS[@]}"; do
  wget "${URL}"
done
```

### Error messages

* Print error messages to stderr.
* Error messages don't have any prefixes like "ERROR:" or "WARNING:".
* Use sentence casing to capitalize error messages.
* Omit trailing punctuation on error messages.

```bash
echo 'Mount mode must be either FLASH or CDROM' >&2
```

## JavaScript

TinyPilot doesn't have well-defined conventions for JavaScript. We are "loosely inspired" by [Google's JavaScript style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html), but don't observe it strictly.

The convention is to try to be consistent with existing code in the TinyPilot repos.
